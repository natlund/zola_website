During my physics PhD, I had to use the Variational or 'Weak' Form of a PDE, which derives from the Calculus of Variations.  Since I had never encountered any of this in my class-based education, I had to teach myself, using whatever resources I could find on the web.  All the stuff I found was clearly aimed at mathematicians - it was very terse, and got the motivating physics wrong.  When I finally had a grip on the maths, I wrote a fairly detailed exposition of the calculus of variations, and included it as an appendix to my thesis.

This is what I would have wanted to learn from when I started: it is aimed at physicists, so no large leaps in mathematical reasoning are made, and the motivating physics is not confusingly wrong.  Other explorers may find it useful, so I have compiled the appendix (with Latex) as a standalone chapter, and made the PDF available here:

[Calculus of Variations and the Variational or 'Weak' Form of PDEs](../Variational_Calculus_Nat_Lund.pdf)

It may just be the easiest explanation of calculus of variations (and the variational or 'weak' form) on the internet.
