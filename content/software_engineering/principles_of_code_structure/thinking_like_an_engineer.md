# Thinking Like An Engineer

## Format Code Perfectly At All Times

Keep code formatting perfect at all times.  _Don't_ say to yourself "I'll come back and fix the formatting later."  Write your code in the same way that a professional chef would practise 'clean as you go' in a busy commercial kitchen.  This discipline helps instil both the attention to detail and sensitivity to structure that characterise a good engineering mind.
