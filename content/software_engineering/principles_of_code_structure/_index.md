This collection of essays form the chapters of a short book of advice that I give to fellow software engineers to help them write better code.

**Why should you trust my advice?**  I began teaching myself Python in 2008, and have worked as a data scientist or software engineer since 2016.  Perhaps more importantly, I have some expertise in technical writing: I used my PhD as an opportunity to learn to write.  This matters because I have come to realise that the principles of good technical writing are closely analagous to the principles of writing good software, so insights from prose writing are applicable.  However, there are _vast_ areas of software engineering that I know nothing about.  These are the opinions of one engineer; user discretion is advised.  As I gain more experience and insight, I will improve and extend this book.
