#### Abstract

The full and proper Scrum methodology has a lot of bureaucratic overhead that costs a lot of engineers' time.  The only benefit of Scrum is a statistical metric of team productivity.  That benefit can only be realised in a very specific theoretical use case.  Real-world usages of Scrum seldom meet that use case.  Therefore, almost all usages of Scrum involve a very high cost with no benefit.

## What isn't Scrum?

There are always people who will defend Scrum, in varying degrees.  Very often it turns out that they are not defending the full Scrum system, but merely some aspect of it that is useful. Let's consider a few of those aspects.

### Tickets
Having a specific unit of work encoded in a 'ticket' is not unique to Scrum.  In fact, Scrum can be done without using a formal ticketing system at all.  Tickets may be paper sticky notes, or digital, living in some ticketing system such as the dreaded _Jira_ from Atlassian.

Tickets are generally an excellent strategy for managing work:  Each unit of work is fully described in a single ticket, with a status that is easy to change and track, and space for comments and discussions on the work.  Tickets can be organised in a classic 'Kanban' board that shows all relevant ticket statuses in a glance.

### Regular Conversations
People working on the same project will naturally talk to each other on a regular basis, as necessary.  Engineers may need to catch up every day.  To get a sense of progress, managers may need progress check-ins perhaps weekly.  We cannot assume that one size fits all.  'Daily Standups', 'Weekly Catch Ups', 'Fortnightly Reviews' may or may not be useful for the particular project at a particular time.

### Rough Planning In Approximate Fortnightly Blocks
Common sense.

## Defining Features of Scrum

1. All work is done in Sprints - precise blocks of time, often two weeks.
2. The work that will be done in the Sprint is agreed up front at the beginning of the Sprint.
3. The work in the Sprint is not changed.
4. At the end of the Sprint, the team assesses the work that was planned for the Sprint versus the work that actually got done.  Any shortfall is analysed ad nauseum, to learn lessons, so that it won't happen again.
