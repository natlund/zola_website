This website records things that I think about.  What is useful to one explorer may be useful to another, so I have made some effort to make the content easy to understand, and easy to find and engage with.

Therefore, this is not a blog.  As the the original name 'web-log' implies, a blog is a sequence of articles in chronological order, indexed by calendar date.  This calendar-based format is appropriate for contemporaneous commentary about current events. But for content of a technical nature, this 'date + keywords' format is not optimal for discovering and reading articles in the right order.  Too many good technical blogs suffer from this.  Thus, instead, this website organises essays into a tree of various logical categories.

I trained in theoretical physics, and work as a software engineer in financial services in the city of London, United Kingdom.
